    "- Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Done:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The **\"BusinessParking\"** and **\"Ambience\"** columns contain nested attributes. If present, they store structured data in dictionary-like formats (e.g., for **BusinessParking**:  \n",
    "    `\"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}\"`,  \n",
    "    for **Ambience**:  \n",
    "    `\"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}\"`).  \n",
    "    We extracted and processed these nested attributes with one-hot encoding. Also, if a business lacks **BusinessParking** or **Ambience** data, we set all values to zero to handle missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The columns **\"address,\" \"city,\" \"state,\" \"postal_code,\" \"latitude,\"** and **\"longitude\"** contain geographical location data for restaurants or businesses. We found an augmental dataset on Kaggle with income data that could be joined on ZIP codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **To-Do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **\"RestaurantsAttire\"** column contains inconsistent values, including:  \n",
    "    `\"u'casual'\"`, `nan`, `\"'casual'\"`, `\"u'dressy'\"`, `\"'dressy'\"`, `\"'formal'\"`, `\"u'formal'\"`.  \n",
    "    We need to standardize these values and clarify their meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The **\"categories\"** column stores a comma-separated string of labels, such as:  \n",
    "    `\"Restaurants, Gluten-Free, Bars, Food, Nightlife, Sandwiches, Burgers\"`.  \n",
    "    We should split these into individual categorical variables for better usability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "  Below are some basic text processing methods considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **SBERT Embeddings**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Topic Modeling (LDA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **TF-IDF Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "  These methods, while conventional, may introduce excessive noise, sparsity, or irrelevant features. Some approaches (e.g., LDA, TF-IDF) lack deep contextual understanding, while others (e.g., SBERT) may be too complex relative to the dataset size. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  **To-Do:**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Further Investigation of Existing Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Evaluate whether they actually help with prediction. We can add one technique at a time to see if it helps with performance. Some other useful techniques include permutation importance or SHAP values for feature selection.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Implement other preprocessing steps for simple methods (TF-IDF and LDA), including stopword removal, stemming, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Some minor things to do for specific technique, including hyperparameter tuning for LDA, comparison of sentiment scores against key business indicators to determine their predictive value. Also SBERT embeddings might not be the most optimal embedding, so we can try Word2Vec or GloVe as well. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Other NLP Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Experiment with domain-specific adaptations of BERT (e.g., DistilBERT, RoBERTa) using a small dataset of labeled business reviews.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Use transformer-based models to extract contextualized word importance instead of relying solely on TF-IDF.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Develop a pipeline combining LDA for topic extraction with embeddings for semantic similarity scoring.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Investigate if zero-shot classifiers like Mistral or OpenAI’s CLIP can generalize well on sentiment and topic classification without requiring extensive labeled data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "  The current model is used primarily for testing purposes. A key challenge in this project is the severe class imbalance in target variables such as **usefulness** and **price range**, which requires careful handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **To-Do:**\n",
    "  - select an appropriate model, training strategy, and hyperparameter tuning approach.\n",
    "  - research and implement techniques to address class imbalance.\n",

    "# Predicting Attributes for Businesses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary approaches for this dataset:  \n",
    "1. Predict attributes at the **individual review** level.  \n",
    "2. Predict attributes at the **business** level.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If we aim to predict business attributes such as **price range, ambience,** or similar characteristics, the following roadmap outlines the necessary steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. revert to the full dataset (instead of the sample dataset) and apply the following transformations.\n",
    "2. since the goal is to predict attributes for businesses rather than individual reviews, we should aggregate the dataset at the **business level**.\n",
    "3. decide how to handle various attributes. Below are suggested approaches:\n",
    "    - remove `user_id' since user identity is irrelevant for business-level predictions\n",
    "    - the following attributes should remain **constant** for a business across all its reviews. We can simply copy them from any review associated with that business:  \n",
    "        - `business_id`\n",
    "        - `name`\n",
    "        - `business_stars`\n",
    "        - `business_review_count`\n",
    "        - `BusinessParking`\n",
    "        - `Ambience`\n",
    "        - `RestaurantsAttire`\n",
    "        - `RestaurantsPriceRange2`\n",
    "        - `categories`\n",
    "    - `stars`, `useful`, `cool`: These are properties of individual reviews. Are they still useful when aggregating at the business level? We need to determine whether to retain, aggregate (e.g., average), or discard them.\n",
    "    - `user_review_count`, `user_useful`, `user_funny`, `user_cool`, `average_stars`, `fans`, `compliment_hot`, `compliment_more`, `compliment_profile`, `compliment_cute`, `compliment_list`, `compliment_note`, `compliment_plain`, `compliment_cool`, `compliment_funny`, `compliment_writer`, `compliment_photos`  \n",
    "    These attributes describe individual users. Should we **remove** them entirely, or **aggregate** them (e.g., taking the median) as a proxy for a typical reviewer’s profile for each business?\n",
    "    - `text`: we can combine all review texts for a business into a single large paragraph while maintaining structure to differentiate individual reviews. One possible format:  \"{review: ...} {review: ...}...\"\n",
    "4. once the transformations are complete, we should extract a subset of businesses from the full dataset for exploratory analysis.\n",
    "5. from this point onward, the workflow will align with the framework for predicting at the **individual review level** (outlined later). The main difference will be the **target variable**, but adjusting the framework should be straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Predicting Attributes for Individual Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code provides an example of how to predict an attribute for each individual review. In this case, we use \"useful\" votes as the attribute of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each business, we first calculate the average number of useful votes received across all its reviews. Each individual review is then compared against this average and classified into one of three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Average\" – if the review's useful votes are close to the business's average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"More useful\" – if the review has significantly more useful votes than the business's average.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Less useful\" – if the review has significantly fewer useful votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to categorize reviews relative to their business, rather than using an absolute threshold, making the classification more context-aware."
